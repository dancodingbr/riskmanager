### Roadmap

_(basically, is a strategic plan that defines a software development goals or desired outcome and includes the major steps or milestones needed to reach it.)_

The goals of this project should follow what it was defined in the main features proposed initially. See [README.md](https://github.com/dancodingbr/riskmanager). Certainly, changes will be applied during future releases when it's necessary.

### Iteration Plans

_(what the team will do (implement) during a iteration planned, generally in 4 weeks (1 month). At the end of each iteration, we want to have a version of the application that can be used by the users.)_

The iteration plans could contains a set of features or bugfixes to develop. 

By now, there aren't any deadlines defined, but the milestone is marked for a version that is validated and ready to use.

At the end of each iteration, we want to have a version of the application that can be used by the users.

This is the list of main features that should be developed, according to [requirements](https://github.com/dancodingbr/riskmanager/blob/main/docs/02_requirements.md) and sorted by the most important:

- Analyze the results of a problem solution
- Choose the effective action plans for the problem
- Register tasks to do for each action plan
- Create potential action plans to solve a problem
- Register a problem


### Endgame Plans 

_(the final week of the milestone. During this week the team will wrap up any feature work, they will test using a test plan Iteration Plans, and then they will fix the critical bugs for that milestone.)_

### Workflow

_(image of basic workflow. ex. git flow, trunk based, github flow)_

In this project, we'll use a custom workflow based essentially on Github Flow. It's composed by the following branches:

- **master**
- **development**: it can used to validate the changes made on bugfix or feature branches before rebase with the master branch
- **bugfix**
- **feature**

#### Make Pull Requests

Reference: _https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312_

Steps:

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.

- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.

- Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner-username/original-repo-name.git
```

- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from "development" if it exists, else from main.

```sh
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code. 

- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.

- If the project has tests run them!

- Write or adapt tests as needed.

- Add or change the documentation as needed.

- Add the changes

```sh
git add .
```

- Commit the changes

```sh
git commit -am "your_comment"
```

- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary. Warning! Not rebase public branches: it should NOT be used on commit history that has already been pushed and shared on a remote repository.

```sh
git log
git checkout feature/feature-name
git rebase -i hash-parent-commit
git log --oneline
```

- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.

```sh
git push --set-upstream origin feature/feature-name
```

- Create a new Pull Request.

- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's "development" branch if there is one, else go for master!

- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

- Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.


#### Commit Messages Style
