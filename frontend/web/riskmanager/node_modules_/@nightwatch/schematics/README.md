This project is a Schematics implementation that allows you to easily integrate [Nightwatch][nightwatchlink] into your Angular projects.

**This Schematic will:**

üèóÔ∏è Install Nightwatch, and it's dependencies  
‚öôÔ∏è Add NPM scripts for running Nightwatch tests  
üì¶ Scaffold base Nightwatch config and test files  
‚ùì Prompt for removal of Protractor files and configuration

## Angular

### ‚ú® Demo

![Nightwatch Schematics Demo](.github/assets/angular-demo.gif)

### üöÄ Usage

Run as one command in an Angular CLI app directory. Note this will add the schematic as a dependency to your project.

```bash
ng add @nightwatch/schematics
```

One can provide following options:
| Option | Description |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| noBuilder | This will skip the builder addition, leaving the angular.json file unmodified and requiring you to run Nightwatch from the command line or through your IDE. Include --noBuilder in your ng add command. |

With the custom builder installed, you can run Nightwatch with the following commands:

```bash
ng e2e
```

```bash
ng run {your-project-name}:nightwatch-run
```

These two commands do the same thing. They will run nightwatch e2e tests.

Once Nightwatch is added to your project, all [Nightwatch CLI options][nightwatchclioptionslink] will be available when triggering e2e tests. E.g.: `--verbose`, `--retries` etc.

### ‚ú® Demo

### üöÄ Usage

Install [Schematics CLI][schematicsclilink] globally

```bash
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
```

Install [Nightwatch-schematics][nightwatchschematicslink] in your project

```bash
npm install @nightwatch/schematics
```

Run following command to install Nightwatch in your project:

```bash
schematics @nightwatch/schematics:ng-add
```

Once Nightwatch is added to your project, all [Nightwatch CLI options][nightwatchclioptionslink] will be available when triggering e2e tests. E.g.: `--verbose`, `--retries` etc. One can update `e2e:test` to include cli options.

### I created new angular project, how do I remove Protractor and install Nightwatch?

It's very simple, you just have to run `ng add @nightwatch/schematics` command, and it will prompt you to remove Protractor from angular project.

### How do I run on another browser that was initially selected in angular app?

All you have to do is install the relevant drivers, and replace `env` value (Check the column names in the [table](#drivers-available-to-install) below) `env-name` in `angular.json`. The config in `angular.json` will look like this.

```javascript
  "nightwatch-run": {
    "builder": "@nightwatch/schematics:nightwatch",
    "options": {
      "devServerTarget": "angularapp:serve",
      "tsConfig": "../nightwatch/tsconfig.e2e.json",
      "config": "./nightwatch.conf.js",
      "env": "<env-name>"
    },
    "configurations": {
      "production": {
        "devServerTarget": "angularapp:serve:production"
      }
    }
  },
  "e2e": {
    "builder": "@nightwatch/schematics:nightwatch",
    "options": {
      "devServerTarget": "angularapp:serve",
      "tsConfig": "../nightwatch/tsconfig.e2e.json",
      "config": "./nightwatch.conf.js",
      "env": "<env-name>"
    },
    "configurations": {
      "production": {
        "devServerTarget": "angularapp:serve:production"
      }
    }
  }
```

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Development

### Getting Started

üõ†Ô∏è [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) are required for the scripts. Make sure it's installed on your machine.

‚¨áÔ∏è **Install** the dependencies for the schematic and the sandbox application

```bash
npm i && cd sandbox && npm i && cd ..
```

üñá **Link** the schematic in the sandbox to run locally

```bash
npm run link:sandbox
```

üèÉ **Run** the schematic

```bash
npm run build:clean:launch
```

## üß™ E2E Testing

Execute the schematic against the sandbox. It will add Nightwatch config, tests, and custom builder, then run e2e tests in the sandbox.

```bash
npm run test
```

## üß™ Unit Testing

Run the unit tests using Jasmine as a runner and test framework

```bash
npm run build:test
npm run test:unit
```

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Reset the Sandbox

Running the schematic locally performs file system changes. The sandbox is version-controlled so that viewing a diff of the changes is trivial. After the schematic has run locally, reset the sandbox with the following.

```bash
npm run clean
```
